# Spring 2026 Geometry

Instructor: [Yi Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/yizhuhomepage/home)

Class Schedule: Saturday 4-4:50 PM

招收对象：6-8年级的学生

课程介绍：本课程将介绍中学数学竞赛（包括MOEMS、Mathcounts、AMC 8/10）中常见的几何专题和技巧。课程内容将包括专题讲座与课堂互动讨论，旨在激发学生对数学的兴趣，从而让学生更自我推动的去准备数学竞赛。该课程适合五年级至八年级并且对中文学校学校基础课程学有余力的同学。本学期的课程内容专注于几何。新学期的课程不需要之前上过此课程。

Course Information: Course Introduction: This course will provide an in-depth exploration of geometry topics and strategies in middle school math competitions, including MOEMS, Mathcounts, and AMC 8/10. The course will include both lectures and interactive class discussions, with the goal of sparking students' interest in mathematics and helping them more self-motivated to prepare the competition. This course is suitable for students in grades 5 through 8 who have a strong grasp of the foundational curriculum offered by Chinese schools. The planned content for the Spring 2026 semester focuses on geometry. Prior enrollment in this course is not required.
