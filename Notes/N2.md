## Lecture 2: Duality and Desargues' Theorem

### The Duality of points and lines

#### Point–Line Duality in the Projective Plane

In the projective plane, there is a near-perfect symmetry between points and lines. We can summarize some basic dual pairs in a table:

| Object / Statement                        | Dual Object / Statement                            |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| point                                     | line                                               |
| line                                      | point                                              |
| infinitely many points on a line          | infinitely many lines through a point             |
| two distinct points determine one line    | two distinct lines meet in one point (**except for parallel lines**) |
| three points are collinear                | three lines are concurrent                         |
| three non-collinear points                | three non-concurrent lines                         |

If you take a statement about points and lines and systematically swap these words using the rule above, you get another correct theorem: the **dual statement**. The following pictures illustrate the duality between points on lines and lines through points.

### Desargues' Triangles and Configuration

**Desargues' theorem** is one of the most fundamental results in projective geometry, discovered by Girard Desargues in 1639. It establishes a beautiful relationship between two triangles that are in perspective.

#### Definition: Desargues Triangles

Two triangles $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$ are called **Desargues triangles** (or **centrally perspective**) if the lines connecting corresponding vertices are concurrent. That is, the three lines $AA'$, $BB'$, and $CC'$ meet at a single point, often denoted as $O$.

Now we apply the duality principle to define the dual concept for Desargues' configuration. 

| Object / Statement                        | Dual Object / Statement                            |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| vertices of the triangle                                   | edges (sides) of the triangle                       |
| line $AA'$ joining corresponding vertices                 | intersection point $R = AB \cap A'B'$ of corresponding sides |
| 3 concurrent lines                                         | 3 collinear points                                  |
| Desargues triangles (perspective from a point)            | dual Desargues triangles (perspective from a line)  |

Two triangles are called **dual Desargues triangles** if the three intersection points $R,S,T$ of corresponding sides are collinear, that is, sitting on the same line. Specifically:
- Let $R$ be the intersection of lines $AB$ and $A'B'$
- Let $S$ be the intersection of lines $BC$ and $B'C'$
- Let $T$ be the intersection of lines $CA$ and $C'A'$
The common line through $R,S,T$ is called the **perspective axis**, dual to the **perspective center** $O$.

### Desargues' Theorem (Statement)

**Theorem (Desargues):** Two triangles form Desargues triangles if and only if they are dual Desargues triangles.

![Desargues' configuration](images/DesarguesTheorem_700.svg)

In other words:
- If triangles $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$ are Desargues triangles with center $O$ (meaning $AA'$, $BB'$, $CC'$ meet at $O$), then the three intersection points of corresponding sides lie on a line.
- Conversely, if the intersection points of corresponding sides lie on a line, then the lines connecting corresponding vertices meet at a point.

This configuration is called a **Desargues configuration**. It consists of:
- 10 points: vertices $A, B, C, A', B', C'$, center $O$, and three axis points $R, S, T$
- 10 lines: sides of both triangles, the three lines through $O$, and the perspective axis

Notice the beautiful symmetry: **10 points and 10 lines**!

### Proof Sketch (3D Method)

One elegant proof uses three-dimensional geometry:
- Imagine the two triangles $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$ lying in different planes in 3D space
- If corresponding vertices are connected through a point $O$ outside both planes, the lines $AA'$, $BB'$, $CC'$ naturally meet at $O$
- The sides of the triangles lie in their respective planes
- Corresponding sides (like $AB$ and $A'B'$) lie in a plane that contains both lines
- The intersection of this plane with both triangle planes gives a line
- All three such intersection points lie on the line of intersection of the two triangle planes, which is exactly the perspective axis
- This proves that $R,S,T$ are collinear!


### Special Cases and Degenerate Configurations

When the two triangles lie in the same plane, Desargues' theorem still holds, but special care must be taken with:
- Parallel lines (which meet at "points at infinity" in projective geometry)
- Degenerate cases where some points coincide

In Euclidean geometry, if some corresponding sides are parallel, the theorem still applies by considering parallel lines as meeting at infinity.
